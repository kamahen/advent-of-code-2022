Solved using SWI-Prolog version 9.1.0

`swipl -g solve -t halt 7.pl`

To run the unit tests:
`swipl -g run_tests -t halt 7.test.pl`

Files:

- `7.pl`: the program
- `7.input0`: the small example input, from the problem statement
- `7.dirs0`: the directory from 7.input0, given in the problem
- `7.test.pl`: some unit tests. This also contains `7.dirs0`, as a Prolog tree (see `expected_tree/1`).
- `7.input`: the large input
